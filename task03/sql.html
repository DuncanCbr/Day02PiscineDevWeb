        <abbr title="SQL">Structured Query Language</abbr> (SQL) (/ˌɛsˌkjuɛl/ ⓘ S-Q-L, sometimes /sikwəl/
        "sequel" for historical reasons)[4][5] is a domain-specific language
        used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational
        database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a
        relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly
        useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations
        among entities and variables. Introduced in the 1970s, SQL offered two
        main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM.
        Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one
        single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach
        a record, i.e., with or without an index.
